You’ll find this post in your `news/_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

## Adding New Posts

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `news/_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

### Images

Lightbox has been enabled for images. To create the link that'll launch the lightbox, add <code>data-lightbox</code> and <code>data-title</code> attributes to an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag around your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. The result is:

<center>
<a href="/images/gallery/P1110635.jpg" data-lightbox="example" data-title="bla bla blub">
  <img src="/images/gallery/P1110635_thumb.jpg" title="bla bla yay">
</a>
</center>
