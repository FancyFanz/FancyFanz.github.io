I wish you all a Happy New Year and thank you for the past year! 

2023 was exciting, especially because I started to be able to accept horses for rehabilitation and treatment here in our stable and it got off to a good start with great clients. Also, a new vet specialised in horse teeth joined the collaboration group and it has been very fun and informative to observe and work with [Jana Zedelius](https://www.hestatannheilsa.is/en). 

Our horses are lucky that more and more professionals specialising in all the different areas of horsemanship, training or health are available in the country! And together we can give our horses a happy life with us.
