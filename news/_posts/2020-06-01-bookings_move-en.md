After maternity leave I'm back at treating horses and have already visited a few. As some of you know I moved to the countryside, to Sn√¶fellsnes, but don't worry I will continue to arrange visits to your horses. I receive bookings by phone or email. Please contact me and we will find time for an appointment together.
