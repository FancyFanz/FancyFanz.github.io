title: Equine Dentistry - Jana Zedelius
summary:
    70 to 85 percent of horses have undiagnosed dental problems. It is more common for the problems to become apparent when the horse is ridden, but most horses show no, or very subtle, chewing problems. Horses are masters at hiding dental problems, partly because they can continue to eat on the other, better side. Therefore, regular dental checkups along with correction of any recurring malocclusions are essential to keep the horse healthy. 
  Annual dental checkups uncover problems early! It goes without saying that a horse without pain associated with the teeth and in a balanced bite is a prerequisite for a happy riding horse.

My experiences with Jana are very good, on her [home page](https://www.hestatannheilsa.is/) you will find answers to the most common questions such as e.g. why do horses need a dentist? What about wild horses? What is the difference between Jana's treatment and regular rasping/floating? What is the price for basic dental treatment and what is included?
Your horses will thank you.
