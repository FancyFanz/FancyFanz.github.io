I also offer the service of having your horse at my stable in Böðvarsholt, on the southern side of Snæfellsnes, for physical therapy and rehabilitation training. Your horse will stay in a spacious box, with plenty of outdoor paddock time, he'll receive hay, one physiotherapy treatment and rehabilitation training that suits his needs and condition for 97.000,- isk per month (or 57.000,- isk for 2 weeks). Depending on your horses needs and your wishes, we can add more treatments during his stay for 12.000,- isk, and of course you can bring supplemental feed for the horse, which he will then receive while he stays with us.
